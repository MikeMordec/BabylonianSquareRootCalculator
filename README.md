Babylonian Square Root Calculator
Overview

The Babylonian Square Root Calculator is a Python implementation of the Babylonian method (also known as Heron's method) for calculating the square root of a given positive real number. This algorithm provides an efficient and iterative approach to approximating square roots with high precision.
Features

    Iterative calculation of square roots using the Babylonian method
    Input validation to ensure only positive real numbers are processed
    Clear output of each iteration and the final approximate result
    User-friendly interface for input and output

Usage

    Clone the repository to your local machine:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/BabylonianSquareRootCalculator.git

Navigate to the project directory:

bash

cd BabylonianSquareRootCalculator

Run the script using Python:

bash

    python BabylonianSquareRootCalculator.py

    Enter a positive real number when prompted to calculate its square root.
